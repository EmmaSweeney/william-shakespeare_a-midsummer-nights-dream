			<h2><b>ACT II</b></h2>
<h3><b>SCENE I. A wood near Athens</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter a <span class="charname">Fairy</span> at one door, and
<span class="charname">Puck</span> at another.</p>
<p>
PUCK.<br/>
How now, spirit! Whither wander you?
</p>
<p>
FAIRY<br/>
    Over hill, over dale,<br/>
        Thorough bush, thorough brier,<br/>
    Over park, over pale,<br/>
        Thorough flood, thorough fire,<br/>
    I do wander everywhere,<br/>
    Swifter than the moon’s sphere;<br/>
    And I serve the Fairy Queen,<br/>
    To dew her orbs upon the green.<br/>
    The cowslips tall her pensioners be,<br/>
    In their gold coats spots you see;<br/>
    Those be rubies, fairy favours,<br/>
    In those freckles live their savours.<br/>
I must go seek some dew-drops here,<br/>
And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.<br/>
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I’ll be gone.<br/>
Our Queen and all her elves come here anon.
</p>
<p>
PUCK.<br/>
The King doth keep his revels here tonight;<br/>
Take heed the Queen come not within his sight,<br/>
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<br/>
Because that she, as her attendant, hath<br/>
A lovely boy, stol’n from an Indian king;<br/>
She never had so sweet a changeling.<br/>
And jealous Oberon would have the child<br/>
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild:<br/>
But she perforce withholds the lovèd boy,<br/>
Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.<br/>
And now they never meet in grove or green,<br/>
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,<br/>
But they do square; that all their elves for fear<br/>
Creep into acorn cups, and hide them there.<br/>
</p>
<p>
FAIRY<br/>
Either I mistake your shape and making quite,<br/>
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite<br/>
Call’d Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he<br/>
That frights the maidens of the villagery,<br/>
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,<br/>
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn,<br/>
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,<br/>
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?<br/>
Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,<br/>
You do their work, and they shall have good luck.<br/>
Are not you he?
</p>
<p>
PUCK.<br/>
Thou speak’st aright;<br/>
I am that merry wanderer of the night.<br/>
I jest to Oberon, and make him smile,<br/>
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,<br/>
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal;<br/>
And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl<br/>
In very likeness of a roasted crab,<br/>
And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,<br/>
And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.<br/>
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,<br/>
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;<br/>
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,<br/>
And ‘tailor’ cries, and falls into a cough;<br/>
And then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe<br/>
And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear<br/>
A merrier hour was never wasted there.<br/>
But room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.<br/>
</p>
<p>
FAIRY<br/>
And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Oberon</span> at one door,
with his Train, and <span class="charname">Titania</span> at another, with hers.</p>
<p>
OBERON.<br/>
Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
</p>
<p>
TITANIA.<br/>
What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;<br/>
I have forsworn his bed and company.
</p>
<p>
OBERON.<br/>
Tarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?
</p>
<p>
TITANIA.<br/>
Then I must be thy lady; but I know<br/>
When thou hast stol’n away from fairyland,<br/>
And in the shape of Corin sat all day<br/>
Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love<br/>
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,<br/>
Come from the farthest steep of India,<br/>
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,<br/>
Your buskin’d mistress and your warrior love,<br/>
To Theseus must be wedded; and you come<br/>
To give their bed joy and prosperity?
</p>
<p>
OBERON.<br/>
How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,<br/>
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,<br/>
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?<br/>
Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night<br/>
From Perigenia, whom he ravished?<br/>
And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,<br/>
With Ariadne and Antiopa?
</p>
<p>
TITANIA.<br/>
These are the forgeries of jealousy:<br/>
And never, since the middle summer’s spring,<br/>
Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,<br/>
By pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook,<br/>
Or on the beachèd margent of the sea,<br/>
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,<br/>
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our sport.<br/>
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,<br/>
As in revenge, have suck’d up from the sea<br/>
Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,<br/>
Hath every pelting river made so proud<br/>
That they have overborne their continents.<br/>
The ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain,<br/>
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn<br/>
Hath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard.<br/>
The fold stands empty in the drownèd field,<br/>
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;<br/>
The nine-men’s-morris is fill’d up with mud,<br/>
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,<br/>
For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.<br/>
The human mortals want their winter here.<br/>
No night is now with hymn or carol blest.<br/>
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,<br/>
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,<br/>
That rheumatic diseases do abound.<br/>
And thorough this distemperature we see<br/>
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts<br/>
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;<br/>
And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown<br/>
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds<br/>
Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,<br/>
The childing autumn, angry winter, change<br/>
Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world,<br/>
By their increase, now knows not which is which.<br/>
And this same progeny of evils comes<br/>
From our debate, from our dissension;<br/>
We are their parents and original.
</p>
<p>
OBERON.<br/>
Do you amend it, then. It lies in you.<br/>
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?<br/>
I do but beg a little changeling boy<br/>
To be my henchman.
</p>
<p>
TITANIA.<br/>
Set your heart at rest;<br/>
The fairyland buys not the child of me.<br/>
His mother was a vot’ress of my order,<br/>
And in the spicèd Indian air, by night,<br/>
Full often hath she gossip’d by my side;<br/>
And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,<br/>
Marking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood,<br/>
When we have laugh’d to see the sails conceive,<br/>
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;<br/>
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait<br/>
Following (her womb then rich with my young squire),<br/>
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,<br/>
To fetch me trifles, and return again,<br/>
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.<br/>
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;<br/>
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,<br/>
And for her sake I will not part with him.
</p>
<p>
OBERON.<br/>
How long within this wood intend you stay?
</p>
<p>
TITANIA.<br/>
Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding-day.<br/>
If you will patiently dance in our round,<br/>
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;<br/>
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
</p>
<p>
OBERON.<br/>
Give me that boy and I will go with thee.
</p>
<p>
TITANIA.<br/>
Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.<br/>
We shall chide downright if I longer stay.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Titania</span> with her Train.</i>]</p>
<p>
OBERON.<br/>
Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove<br/>
Till I torment thee for this injury.—<br/>
My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest<br/>
Since once I sat upon a promontory,<br/>
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back<br/>
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath<br/>
That the rude sea grew civil at her song<br/>
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres<br/>
To hear the sea-maid’s music.
</p>
<p>
PUCK.<br/>
I remember.
</p>
<p>
OBERON.<br/>
That very time I saw, (but thou couldst not),<br/>
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,<br/>
Cupid all arm’d: a certain aim he took<br/>
At a fair vestal, thronèd by the west,<br/>
And loos’d his love-shaft smartly from his bow<br/>
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.<br/>
But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft<br/>
Quench’d in the chaste beams of the watery moon;<br/>
And the imperial votress passed on,<br/>
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.<br/>
Yet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell:<br/>
It fell upon a little western flower,<br/>
Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,<br/>
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.<br/>
Fetch me that flower, the herb I showed thee once:<br/>
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid<br/>
Will make or man or woman madly dote<br/>
Upon the next live creature that it sees.<br/>
Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again<br/>
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
</p>
<p>
PUCK.<br/>
I’ll put a girdle round about the earth<br/>
In forty minutes.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Puck</span>.</i>]</p>
<p>
OBERON.<br/>
Having once this juice,<br/>
I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep,<br/>
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:<br/>
The next thing then she waking looks upon<br/>
(Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,<br/>
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape)<br/>
She shall pursue it with the soul of love.<br/>
And ere I take this charm from off her sight<br/>
(As I can take it with another herb)<br/>
I’ll make her render up her page to me.<br/>
But who comes here? I am invisible;<br/>
And I will overhear their conference.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Demetrius, Helena</span> following him.</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS.<br/>
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.<br/>
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?<br/>
The one I’ll slay, the other slayeth me.<br/>
Thou told’st me they were stol’n into this wood,<br/>
And here am I, and wode within this wood<br/>
Because I cannot meet with Hermia.<br/>
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
</p>
<p>
HELENA.<br/>
You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant,<br/>
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart<br/>
Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,<br/>
And I shall have no power to follow you.
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS.<br/>
Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?<br/>
Or rather do I not in plainest truth<br/>
Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?
</p>
<p>
HELENA.<br/>
And even for that do I love you the more.<br/>
I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,<br/>
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.<br/>
Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,<br/>
Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,<br/>
Unworthy as I am, to follow you.<br/>
What worser place can I beg in your love,<br/>
(And yet a place of high respect with me)<br/>
Than to be usèd as you use your dog?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS.<br/>
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;<br/>
For I am sick when I do look on thee.
</p>
<p>
HELENA.<br/>
And I am sick when I look not on you.
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS.<br/>
You do impeach your modesty too much<br/>
To leave the city and commit yourself<br/>
Into the hands of one that loves you not,<br/>
To trust the opportunity of night.<br/>
And the ill counsel of a desert place,<br/>
With the rich worth of your virginity.
</p>
<p>
HELENA.<br/>
Your virtue is my privilege: for that.<br/>
It is not night when I do see your face,<br/>
Therefore I think I am not in the night;<br/>
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,<br/>
For you, in my respect, are all the world.<br/>
Then how can it be said I am alone<br/>
When all the world is here to look on me?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS.<br/>
I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,<br/>
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
</p>
<p>
HELENA.<br/>
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.<br/>
Run when you will, the story shall be chang’d;<br/>
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;<br/>
The dove pursues the griffin, the mild hind<br/>
Makes speed to catch the tiger. Bootless speed,<br/>
When cowardice pursues and valour flies!
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS.<br/>
I will not stay thy questions. Let me go,<br/>
Or if thou follow me, do not believe<br/>
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
</p>
<p>
HELENA.<br/>
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,<br/>
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!<br/>
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.<br/>
We cannot fight for love as men may do.<br/>
We should be woo’d, and were not made to woo.<br/>
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Demetrius</span>.</i>]</p>
<p>
I’ll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,<br/>
To die upon the hand I love so well.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Helena</span>.</i>]</p>
<p>
OBERON.<br/>
Fare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove,<br/>
Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Puck</span>.</p>
<p>
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
</p>
<p>
PUCK.<br/>
Ay, there it is.
</p>
<p>
OBERON.<br/>
I pray thee give it me.<br/>
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,<br/>
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,<br/>
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,<br/>
With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine.<br/>
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,<br/>
Lull’d in these flowers with dances and delight;<br/>
And there the snake throws her enamell’d skin,<br/>
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.<br/>
And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes,<br/>
And make her full of hateful fantasies.<br/>
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:<br/>
A sweet Athenian lady is in love<br/>
With a disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes;<br/>
But do it when the next thing he espies<br/>
May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man<br/>
By the Athenian garments he hath on.<br/>
Effect it with some care, that he may prove<br/>
More fond on her than she upon her love:<br/>
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
</p>
<p>
PUCK.<br/>
Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt.</i>]</p>
<h3><b><br/>SCENE II. Another part of the wood</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Titania</span> with her Train.</p>
<p>
TITANIA.<br/>
Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;<br/>
Then for the third part of a minute, hence;<br/>
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds;<br/>
Some war with reremice for their leathern wings,<br/>
To make my small elves coats; and some keep back<br/>
The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots and wonders<br/>
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;<br/>
Then to your offices, and let me rest.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"><span class="charname">Fairies</span> sing.</p>
<p>
FIRST FAIRY.<br/>
    You spotted snakes with double tongue,<br/>
       Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;<br/>
    Newts and blind-worms do no wrong,<br/>
       Come not near our Fairy Queen:
</p>
<p>
CHORUS.<br/>
    Philomel, with melody,<br/>
    Sing in our sweet lullaby:<br/>
Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby.<br/>
    Never harm, nor spell, nor charm,<br/>
    Come our lovely lady nigh;<br/>
    So good night, with lullaby.
</p>
<p>
FIRST FAIRY.<br/>
    Weaving spiders, come not here;<br/>
       Hence, you long-legg’d spinners, hence.<br/>
    Beetles black, approach not near;<br/>
       Worm nor snail do no offence.
</p>
<p>
CHORUS.<br/>
    Philomel with melody, &amp;c.

SECOND FAIRY.<br/>

OBERON.<br/>
What thou seest when thou dost wake,
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Squeezes the flower on  <span class="charname">Titania’s</span>
eyelids.</i>]</p>
<p>
Do it for thy true love take;<br/>
Love and languish for his sake.<br/>
Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,<br/>
Pard, or boar with bristled hair,<br/>
In thy eye that shall appear<br/>
When thou wak’st, it is thy dear.<br/>
Wake when some vile thing is near.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Lysander</span> and
<span class="charname">Hermia</span>.</p>
<p>
LYSANDER.<br/>
Fair love, you faint with wand’ring in the wood.<br/>
And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way.<br/>
We’ll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,<br/>
And tarry for the comfort of the day.
</p>
<p>
HERMIA.<br/>
Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed,<br/>
For I upon this bank will rest my head.
</p>
<p>
LYSANDER.<br/>
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;<br/>
One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.
</p>
<p>
HERMIA.<br/>
Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,<br/>
Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.
</p>
<p>
LYSANDER.<br/>
O take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!<br/>
Love takes the meaning in love’s conference.<br/>
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit,<br/>
So that but one heart we can make of it:<br/>
Two bosoms interchainèd with an oath,<br/>
So then two bosoms and a single troth.<br/>
Then by your side no bed-room me deny;<br/>
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
</p>
<p>
HERMIA.<br/>
Lysander riddles very prettily.<br/>
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,<br/>
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied!<br/>
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy<br/>
Lie further off, in human modesty,<br/>
Such separation as may well be said<br/>
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,<br/>
So far be distant; and good night, sweet friend:<br/>
Thy love ne’er alter till thy sweet life end!
</p>
<p>
LYSANDER.<br/>
Amen, amen, to that fair prayer say I;<br/>
And then end life when I end loyalty!<br/>
Here is my bed. Sleep give thee all his rest!
</p>

HERMIA.<br/>
With half that wish the wisher’s eyes be pressed!

<p>
PUCK.<br/>
Through the forest have I gone,<br/>
But Athenian found I none,<br/>
On whose eyes I might approve<br/>
This flower’s force in stirring love.<br/>
Night and silence! Who is here?<br/>
Weeds of Athens he doth wear:<br/>
This is he, my master said,<br/>
Despisèd the Athenian maid;<br/>
And here the maiden, sleeping sound,<br/>
On the dank and dirty ground.<br/>
Pretty soul, she durst not lie<br/>
Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.<br/>
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw<br/>
All the power this charm doth owe;<br/>
When thou wak’st let love forbid<br/>
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid.<br/>
So awake when I am gone;<br/>
For I must now to Oberon.

HELENA.<br/>
O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!<br/>
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.<br/>
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe’er she lies,<br/>
For she hath blessèd and attractive eyes.<br/>
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears.<br/>
If so, my eyes are oftener wash’d than hers.<br/>
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear,<br/>
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:<br/>
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius<br/>

What wicked and dissembling glass of mine<br/>

Dead or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.<br/>

LYSANDER.<br/>

Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,<br/>
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.<br/>
Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word<br/>
Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
</p>
<p>
HELENA.<br/>
Do not say so, Lysander, say not so.<br/>
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?<br/>
Yet Hermia still loves you. Then be content.
</p>
<p>
LYSANDER.<br/>
Content with Hermia? No, I do repent<br/>
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.<br/>
Not Hermia, but Helena I love.<br/>
Who will not change a raven for a dove?<br/>
The will of man is by his reason sway’d,<br/>
And reason says you are the worthier maid.<br/>
Things growing are not ripe until their season;<br/>
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;<br/>
And touching now the point of human skill,<br/>
Reason becomes the marshal to my will,<br/>
And leads me to your eyes, where I o’erlook<br/>
Love’s stories, written in love’s richest book.
</p>
<p>
HELENA.<br/>
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?<br/>
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?<br/>
Is’t not enough, is’t not enough, young man,<br/>
That I did never, no, nor never can<br/>
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius’ eye,<br/>
But you must flout my insufficiency?<br/>
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,<br/>
In such disdainful manner me to woo.<br/>
But fare you well; perforce I must confess,<br/>
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.<br/>
O, that a lady of one man refus’d,<br/>
Should of another therefore be abus’d!

LYSANDER.<br/>
She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there,<br/>
And never mayst thou come Lysander near!<br/>
For, as a surfeit of the sweetest things<br/>
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings;<br/>
Or as the heresies that men do leave<br/>
Are hated most of those they did deceive;<br/>
So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,<br/>
Of all be hated, but the most of me!<br/>
And, all my powers, address your love and might<br/>
To honour Helen, and to be her knight!

Lysander, look how I do quake with fear.<br/>
Methought a serpent eat my heart away,<br/>
And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.<br/>
Lysander! What, removed? Lysander! lord!<br/>
What, out of hearing? Gone? No sound, no word?<br/>
Alack, where are you? Speak, and if you hear;<br/>
Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.<br/>
No? Then I well perceive you are not nigh.<br/>
